/**
* User Story: Being able to preserve page formatting when text is too large
* 
 * Description: 
 * As a developer, I need an Ellipsis react component that will encapsulate text 
 * data with a fixed max character length so that a text does not occupy  
 * more space than dedicated by default in a UI. 
 * 
 * Acceptance criteria:
 * - Ellipsis is a react component that can be reused
 * - Ellipsis consumes a string **text** value as a property
 * - Elipsis component provides a **length** property that defines the maximum number of characters in the text rendered
 * - Default length value is 20
 * - When text length is > max length, text is cut and an ellipsis (...) is added
* - On user click on text elipsed, the full text is rendered, another mouse click will restore ellipsis
